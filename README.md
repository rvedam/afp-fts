# AFP-FTS: A sample Common Lisp Project

This is a small sample project to illustrate how one might go about developing
an application in Common Lisp. It is currently a fully functioning server with
a small test suite that makes sure the server starts up and shuts down.

## Dependencies

The project itself leverages the following libraries:

- prove (for testing)
- usocket
- bordeaux-threads
